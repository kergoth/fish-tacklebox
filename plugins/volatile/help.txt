This plugin handles some volatile files which you want in an alternate
location. This can be useful when using an NFS home directory, or an SSD home
directory if you're paranoid about unnecessary flash writes/erases.

Set volatile_path to the destination path (e.g. the non-NFS home directory)
prior to initializing tacklebox. Optionally, set volatile_elements to the
elements you want adjusted.

Default elements: ccache viminfo less_history
